### Observed behavior
<!-- Please describe the problem you encountered. -->

The coffee machine dispenses less coffee than usual. I only get around 100ml. 
It still takes the same time as usual. Maybe something is clogged.

### Expected behavior
<!-- What did you expect to happen? -->

It should fill a 200ml cup.

### Steps to reproduce
<!-- Which actions led to the problem? -->

- Press the blue button with the double-cup icon
- Wait for coffee to come out
- Realize your cup is only half full

### Additional context
<!-- Terminal output, screenshots, recordings, or any other useful context -->

None of the maintenance lamps are glowing. 
Water and beans are fine. 
I didn't observe any unexpected sounds or other strange behavior.
